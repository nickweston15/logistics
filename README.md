# README

I built this app to learn more about how users interact with apps
on the web. Specifically, I wanted to understand how to build an API
that was accessible for the user and followed the Model-View-Controller
software design pattern on the backend. Additionally, I taught
myself how to use MongoDB as the data storage platform on this app
just for the sake of adding tools to the toolbelt.
