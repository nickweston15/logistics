  "description": "I built this app to learn more about how users interact with apps on the web. Specifically, I wanted to understand how to build an API that was accessible for the user and followed the Model-View-Controller software design pattern on the backend. Additionally, I taught myself how to use MongoDB as the data storage platform on this app just for the sake of adding tools to the toolbelt.",
